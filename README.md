# Model Notes


The model describes the double phosphorylation of MAP kinase by an ordered
mechanism using the Michaelis-Menten formalism. Two different enzymes, MAPKK1
and MAPKK2, successively phosphorylate the MAP kinase, but one and the same
phosphatase dephosphorylates both sites.  
The model reproduces [figure

in the supplemental material of the article.

Abstract:  
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can operate as bistable
switches residing in either of two different stable states. MAPK cascades are
often embedded in positive feedback loops, which are considered to be a
prerequisite for bistable behavior. Here we demonstrate that in the absence of
any imposed feedback regulation, bistability and hysteresis can arise solely
from a distributive kinetic mechanism of the two-site MAPK phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation. Importantly, the reported kinetic properties of the kinase
(MEK) and phosphatase (MKP3) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
fulfill the essential requirements for generating a bistable switch at a
single MAPK cascade level. Likewise, a cycle where multisite phosphorylations
are performed by different kinases, but dephosphorylation reactions are
catalyzed by the same phosphatase, can also exhibit bistability and
hysteresis. Hence, bistability induced by multisite covalent modification may
be a widespread mechanism of the control of protein activity.
